# Future Jobs Pro AI — retained work register

Updated 2026-10-31. The tester report is the current priority; this register remains open alongside it. Historical failures are not evidence that the current deployed release failed.

## Verified release baseline

- Backend commit `47562984dbae9fb15adcd85b815ff4d18374aebc` deployed to Railway production successfully. Deployment `dbdf55ad-5158-4dda-80a7-fe8e027f17ad`; `/api/health` healthy when checked in the preceding release work.
- Customer web production Ready at `f9204b2`; portal production Ready at `4756298`.
- iOS 1.2.8 build 55 uploaded successfully to App Store Connect through Expo project `samuel33/future-jobs-pro-ai`. Submission `3ee979e0-628d-497f-aa5d-29d45216cda8`. Upload does not establish Apple review approval or physical-device acceptance.
- Previous baseline validation: 202 backend, 29 mobile, 13 portal, and 18 repair tests passed.
- Tester QA changes are tracked separately in `TESTER-REPORT-20261031.md`; they are not part of build 55 or the baseline production deployment.
